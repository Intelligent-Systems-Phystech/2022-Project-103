\section{Problem Statement}
Let $\mathcal{D} = \{(X, y)\}$ be the given dataset, where $X$ is referred to the design matrix and y as target vector. Let $X$ be a vector of PDB codes, which represent an atomic coordinate file of a molecular structure. Thus, $X \in \mathbf{X}^n, y \in \R_+^n$. The problem is now defined as optimizing model $w^*$ with respect to following functional: $w^* = \underset{w}{\mathrm{argmin}} = S(w(\mathcal{D}_T), y_T)$, where S is the error function. The set $\mathcal{D}_T \subset \mathcal{D}$ is a training design subset with corresponding target $y_T$. For the validating purposes we use the quadratic error function: $S(a, b) = ||a-b||_2^2$.
