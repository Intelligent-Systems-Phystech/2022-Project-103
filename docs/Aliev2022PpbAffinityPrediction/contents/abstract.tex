\section{Abstract}
In this work we aim to compile a novel benchmark of PPIs with known binding affinity values from refined data and benchmark the resulting deep learning geometry method against existing state-of-the-art approaches.
We plan to provide a method for selecting the interacting chains based on proximity of atoms.

    Binding Affinity $\cdotp$
    Protein Complexes $\cdotp$
